    'E125',  # continuation line with same indent as next logical line

    'E301',  # expected 1 blank line, found 0  # We allow consecutive exception declarations.
    'E401',  # multiple imports on one line
    'E701',  # multiple statements on one line (colon)  # We allow: `class Exc(Exception): pass`.

# We disable the class factoring check since it flags calls to superclass constructors from nested
# classes.  We do this commonly enough in nested exception classes.
# The error looks like so:
# T800 Instead of Context.CommandError use self.CommandError or cls.CommandError with
#      instancemethods and classmethods respectively.
