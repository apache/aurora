# Design Documents

Since its inception as an Apache project, larger feature additions to the
Aurora code base are discussed in form of design documents. Design documents
are living documents until a consensus has been reached to implement a feature
in the proposed form.

Current and past documents:

* [Command Hooks for the Aurora Client](design/command-hooks.md)
* [Health Checks for Updates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdgW8S4xMhvKW7iQUX99xZm10NXSxEWR0a-21FP5d94/edit)
* [JobUpdateDiff thrift API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fc_YhhV7fc4D9Xv6gJzpfooxbK4YWZcvzw6Bd3qVTL8/edit)
* [REST API RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_lAsYIRlD5ETRzF2eSd3oa8LXAHYFD8rSetspYXaf4/edit)
* [Revocable Mesos offers in Aurora](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1WCHgmPJp5wbrqSZLsgtxPNj3sULfHrSFmxp2GyPTo/edit)
